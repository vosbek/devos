# Product Requirements Document: LLM-Powered Developer OS

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: DevOS - LLM-Native Developer Operating System  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 2025  
**Status**: Design Phase  

DevOS transforms the traditional developer workspace by integrating Large Language Models directly into the operating system layer, enabling natural language interaction with system resources, development tools, and cloud services.

## Product Vision

Create the first LLM-native operating system designed specifically for software developers, where natural language becomes the primary interface for system interaction, development workflows, and cloud resource management.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers** using AWS Workspaces
- **DevOps Engineers** managing cloud infrastructure
- **Technical Leads** overseeing development workflows

### User Personas
1. **Senior Developer**: Wants to accelerate complex tasks and reduce context switching
2. **Junior Developer**: Needs guidance and automation for routine tasks
3. **DevOps Engineer**: Requires system-level automation and monitoring

## Problem Statement

Current developer workflows suffer from:
- **Context Switching**: Constant movement between terminal, IDE, browser, and documentation
- **Command Complexity**: Difficulty remembering complex CLI commands and parameters
- **Workflow Fragmentation**: Disparate tools that don't communicate effectively
- **Knowledge Silos**: Institutional knowledge trapped in documentation and senior developers

## Solution Overview

DevOS provides a unified natural language interface to the entire development ecosystem through:

1. **OS-Level LLM Integration**: Native service for natural language processing
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Understanding of current development state
3. **Intelligent Automation**: Proactive suggestions and automated workflows
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing tools and AWS services

## Core Features

### 1. Natural Language OS Interface
- **Voice Commands**: "Organize my project files by last modified date"
- **Text Commands**: Hotkey-activated command input
- **Contextual Understanding**: Interprets commands based on current workspace state

### 2. Intelligent Developer Assistant
- **Code Analysis**: "Find all unused imports in this project"
- **Environment Management**: "Set up a React development environment"
- **Git Operations**: "Create a feature branch for the user authentication feature"

### 3. Approval & Safety System
- **Permission Boundaries**: Safe operations execute immediately
- **Destructive Operation Approval**: Requires user confirmation
- **Learning System**: "Always approve" for trusted operations

### 4. Contextual Awareness
- **File System Intelligence**: Understands project structure and conventions
- **Process Monitoring**: Aware of running services and applications
- **Git State**: Current branch, uncommitted changes, merge conflicts

### 5. AWS Integration
- **Bedrock Models**: Multiple model tiers for different complexity levels
- **Service Integration**: EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda management
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart model selection based on task complexity

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Developer Productivity**: 30% reduction in task completion time
- **Command Success Rate**: 95% natural language command accuracy
- **User Adoption**: 80% of workspace users actively using DevOS features
- **Error Reduction**: 50% fewer manual errors in routine tasks

### Secondary KPIs
- **Context Switch Reduction**: 40% fewer application switches per hour
- **Documentation Queries**: 60% reduction in external documentation lookups
- **Workflow Automation**: 25% of routine tasks automated

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Configuration management

### System Requirements
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**: Base operating system
- **Python 3.11+**: Runtime environment
- **systemd**: Service management
- **D-Bus**: Inter-process communication

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Model Reliability**: LLM hallucination or incorrect command interpretation
- **Performance Impact**: System responsiveness degradation
- **Integration Complexity**: Ubuntu desktop environment integration challenges

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Command Validation**: Multiple validation layers before execution
- **Fallback Systems**: Traditional interfaces always available
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased feature introduction with user feedback

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (3 months)
- Core daemon and basic file operations
- Simple AWS Bedrock integration
- Basic approval system

### Phase 2: Alpha (6 months)
- Advanced use cases and integrations
